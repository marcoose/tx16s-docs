# TX16S-Docs

A simple web-based generator for 480x272 pixel images to display documentation
screens (reminder image of how switches are configured for a model) on Radiomaster
TX16S or similar.

Use the JSON editor to update text values or remove any of the nodes.  Once rendered,
they can be dragged around to reposition.  Copy the JSON to clipboard using the
button at the top node and save to a file for backup.
